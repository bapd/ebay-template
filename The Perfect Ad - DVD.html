<p style="margin-top: 0em; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em; line-height: normal; padding: 0px; font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">In 1987,&nbsp;<i>Buster</i>&nbsp;was as much an experiment in&nbsp;film&nbsp;as its subject matter was in&nbsp;robbery. Could audiences ignore the rock singer status of Phil Collins in the lead role? Would audiences still be interested in a 25-year-old cash grab that had been considerably devalued by a currency gone metric?&nbsp;By and large&nbsp;the answer to both was "yes", helped considerably by a high budget (for a British film) it perfectly remade the 1960s experience. Collins as Buster Edwards is only one of a gang who all seem doomed to be captured after their Â£2.5 million train heist. The caper is over within 30 minutes. However, the film is really about the love story between Buster and his doting yet long-suffering wife June (an excellent Julie Walters). When the action switches to sun-drenched Mexico, you just know her loyalty is going to be tested to extremes because that's when Collins' award-winning songs kick in! "Two Hearts" and "Groovy Kind of Love" may not be 60s-styled, but the message is that love always conquers time and place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0em; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em; line-height: normal; padding: 0px; font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;"><span style="font-weight: 700;">On the DVD:</span>&nbsp;The transfer is rather average, as are the talent profiles of Collins, Walters, Ralph Brown (the legendary Ronnie Biggs), and director David Green. Making up for them is a 50-minute "Making of" featurette that interviews everyone involved, including the real-life Buster. There's lots of on-set tomfoolery, and some first attempts at the hit songs that hardly flatter Collins' live singing voice! --<i>Paul Tonks</i>&nbsp;--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.</p>
